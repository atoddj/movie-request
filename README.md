# movie-request
Creating a sample site to allow for data entry and interaction

# Getting set up
1. fork or clone this repository
1. Install node js
1. Run this command in terminal while in directory <kbd>npm install</kbd>
1. Configure the slack incoming webhook option - see sample in config folder
1. Configure mongodb username and password - see sample in config folder

# To do list
In no particular order
1. Add user authentication (higher priority)
1. Add ability for admins to change request statuses (higher priority)
1. admin posts for plex statuses (partially implemented)

## Brainstorm
I've also got some ideas that aren't quite ready to be added to the to-do list but I would like to implement in the future.
1. sms/email notifications for request fulfillment
1. additional slack bot control to fulfill requests
1. search our existing database of movies to avoid duplicates
1. Add movie db integration for dropdown selection
