# movie-request
Creating a sample site to allow for data entry and interaction

# Getting set up
1. fork or clone this repository
1. <kbd>npm install</kbd>
1. Configure the slack incoming webhook option
1. Configure mongodb username and password

# To do list
In no particular order
1. Add slack announcement
1. Add admin authentication (higher priority)
1. Add ability for admins to change request statuses (higher priority)
1. Add bootstrap for better looking page

## Brainstorm
I've also got some ideas that aren't quite ready to be added to the to-do list but I would like to implement in the future.
1. admin posts for plex statuses
1. sms/email notifications for request fulfillment
1. additional slack bot control to fulfill requests
1. search our existing database of movies to avoid duplicates
1. Add movie db integration for dropdown selection
